A useless time project that is done by me. It just simply prints the time into terminal "big". You can wirte "make zevksaati" in terminal to run the code.
It can provide a guide for newcomers of C. However the project itself does not aim to accomplish important thing. Maybe a .sh file file can be written for same purpose.
It can be added into environment also.


Since it is one the first exercises of mine in C, I will be sharing the content.
